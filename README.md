# advanced-css-sass-natours

This is a project I built using advanced CSS and SASS. There are a lot of amazing CSS techniques applied to this modern webpage. Credit to Jonas Schmedtmann, author of an online course, for the knowledge imparted. For more amazing CSS techniques, visit http://codingheroes.io/

I used Node Package Manager(NPM) to manage this project including the compilation of SASS.
