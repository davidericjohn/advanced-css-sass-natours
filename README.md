# advanced-css-sass-natours

This is a project I built using advanced CSS and SASS that shows how to build webpages using Flow Layout and how to manage projects in accordance to best practices and known methodologies. There are also a lot of amazing CSS techniques applied to this modern webpage such as responsive design, responsive images, CSS animation, etc.
